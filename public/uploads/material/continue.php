<p><b>E.</b>&nbsp;The Massachusetts Bay Colony was economically successful engaging in trade with England, Mexico and the West Indies. Legal tender included England's pound, Spanish "Pieces of eight", wampum in the 1640s and of course, barter. A shortage of hard currency prompted the colony to call on the respected John Hull to establish a mint, serve as mintmaster and Treasurer in 1652. The Hull Mint produced oak tree, willow tree and the pine tree shillings.<br></p><p><b>F.</b>&nbsp;Political differences with England after the English Restoration led to the revocation of the colonial charter in 1684. King James II established the Dominion of New England in 1686 to bring all of the New England colonies under firmer crown control. The dominion collapsed after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 deposed James, and the Massachusetts Bay Colony reverted to rule under the revoked charter until 1691, when a new charter was issued for the Province of Massachusetts Bay. This province combined the Massachusetts Bay territories with those of the Plymouth Colony and proprietary holdings on Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. Sir William Phips arrived in 1692 bearing the charter and formally took charge of the new province.</p>
